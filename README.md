# Creating a Geogrpahic Heat Map of the City of Toronto

![Sample Output](/sampleOutput.png)

This jupyter notebook is used to serve as an example of how to create a geopgraphic heat map of the city of Toronto using shape files. 

## Dataset

The dataset is a random list of neighbourhoods in Toronto, which will serve to represent a house being sold in that neighbourhood of Toronto. 

## Shape Files

Shape files are used to draw the map of the city of Toronto. These can be obtained from the [Neighbourhoods dataset of The City of Toronto Open Data Initiative](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/)

For convenience, the shape files from that link have been included in this repository, under the forAnalysis folder.
